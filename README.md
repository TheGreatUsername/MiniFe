# MiniFe
A small compiler written in Python for fun.

Compiles a small language called Fe into Intel assembly, then converts it to machine code through NASM and gcc.

## About MiniFe
It's pronounced Minnee Fay, I guess.

There is a bigger language I made called Fe which supports arrays, but MiniFe has a much simpler and I think more intuitive compiler. Normal Fe will eventually make it's way to Github though.

Fe and MiniFe are turing complete and functional languages.
